# New-YouTube-Adblock-workaround (Only for YT on browsers with extensions feature)
#### Detailed description to continue blocking YT ads:
#### Add the ublock Origin extension in Chrome. 
#### In the top right of your browser where you can see your extension icons, click the uBlock Origin icon, then click the gears icon inside the small uBlock origin window to open the Settings. ‚Å†Click the "My Filters" tab in the new uBlock Origin Settings window that opened and paste the code from the file "code.txt":


#### Okay, so if you get blocked after doing the steps above, there is one more thing you can do to sort this problem:
##### Open the uBlock dashboard as you did to put in the code, but this time go to the "Filter lists" tab.
##### Make sure that "Auto-update filter lists" is selected
##### Click the "Purge all caches" at the top of the page and then click "Update now"

##### After doing that, you'll have an ad-free experience.
##### Note: Preferable to do this on a chromium based browser like Chrome, Edge, etc.
